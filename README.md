Course Description
Students learn techniques for building and interpreting mathematical models of real-world phenomena in and across multiple disciplines, including linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, and calculus, with an emphasis on applications in data science and data engineering. Provides students with a firm understanding or review of these fields of mathematics prior to enrolling in courses that assume understanding of mathematical concepts.

Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Apply linear programming methods to real world models.
Analyze and interpret mathematical models.
Calculate and analyze derivatives and integrals of real world models.
Evaluate and interpret probabilistic models.
Solve applications involving multivariate calculus.
Optimize outcomes modeled by graphs and trees.
